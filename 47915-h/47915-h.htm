<h3 class="no-break"><b>THE DUCAL PALACE: VENICE</b></h3>




<p class="p2">"Considered as the principal
representation of the Venetian
school of architecture, the Ducal
Palace is the Parthenon of Venice," wrote
Ruskin. To know its history would be to
know the entire history of the Republic,
for it was not alone the residence of her
doges, but at different epochs her senate-house,
her court of justice, a prison, and
even a place of execution. Combining thus
in one structure, as it does, the greatest
architectural and the greatest historical
importance, there is, perhaps, no more
interesting monument now existing in the
world.</p>

<p>In his suggestive work upon Italy, Taine
has vividly described the effect of a first
sight of the Ducal Palace. "Like a magnificent
jewel in a brilliant setting, it effaces
its surroundings," he writes. "Never has
like architecture been seen. All here is
novel. You feel yourself drawn out of the
conventional; you realize that there is an
entire world outside the Classic or Gothic
forms which we impose on ourselves and
endlessly repeat; that human invention is
illimitable, and that, like nature, it may
break all the rules, and produce a perfect
work after a model opposed in every particular
to that to which we are instructed
to conform. Every habit of the eye is reversed;
and, with surprise and delight, we
here see oriental fancy grafting the full on
the empty instead of the empty on the full.
A colonnade of robust shafts bears a second
and lighter one decorated with ogives and
trefoils, while upon this frail support expands
a massive wall of red and white marble,
whose courses interlace in designs and
reflect the light. Above, a cornice of open
pyramids, pinnacles, spiracles and festoons
intersects the sky with its border,&mdash;a marble
vegetation bristling and blooming above
the vermilion and pearly tones of the
façade.</p>

<p>"You enter the courtyard, and immediately
your eyes are filled with a new richness.
Nothing is bare or cold. Erudite
and critical pedantry has not here intervened,
under the pretext of purity and
correctness, to restrain lively imagination
and the craving for visual enjoyment. The
builders of Venice were not austere; they
did not restrict themselves to the prescriptions
of books; they did not make up their
minds to yawn admiringly at a façade
which had been sanctioned by Vitruvious;
they wanted an architectural work to delight
their whole sentient being. They
decked it with ornaments, columns and
statues, they rendered it luxurious and
joyous. They placed colossal pagans like
Mars and Neptune on it, and flanked them
with biblical figures like Adam and Eve;
the sculptors of the fifteenth century enlivened
it with their lank realistic effigies,
and those of the sixteenth with their animated
and muscular statues.</p>

in the erection of a memorial of her victories

<p>The history of the construction of the
Palace is obscure and confusing,&mdash;a bald
array of senatorial decrees and dates. The
original Doges' Palace, probably a small
fortified castle, was built early in the ninth
century, and in the troublous period of
early Venetian history was frequently
burned and rebuilt. At the end of the
twelfth century Sebastiano Ziani restored
and enlarged it. The present palace was
begun in 1300 by the building of the west
façade, and was a slow growth extending
over nearly three centuries, the older building
of Ziani being gradually pulled down
as room was required for the new work.
About 1309 the arcaded sea-front was
begun; and the design then adopted was
accurately followed along the whole external
façade. Towards the end of the fourteenth
century the façade had been carried
along the Piazzetta side as far as the tenth
capital. At this point the work seems to
have remained stationary for some years,
and a considerable portion of Ziani's palace
was still in existence. In 1422 a decree was
passed that the new palace should be extended
over the site of Ziani's building;
and in a few years the remainder of the
external façade was completed up to its
juncture with the Church of St. Mark.
The Porta della Carta, which unites the
Palace with the Church, was added in
1439. The internal block in the great
court, joining the Porta della Carta to the
east façade was built about 1462. In 1479
a fire consumed part of the fourteenth century
buildings along the east front, and
this part was then rebuilt, mostly between
1480 and 1550. These, in brief, are the
facts (for which we are indebted to the account
of Prof. J. H. Middleton) upon which
historians have in general come to agree,
though there is still difference of opinion
as to the exact portions of the structure to
which the various decrees refer.</p>

<p>An interesting theory concerning the
design of the palace, and incidentally a
critical estimate of its architecture, has
been given us by Mr. George Edmund
Street in his scholarly treatise upon "Brick
and Marble in the Middle Ages." "The
whole design" he writes, "is divided into
three stages in height. The upper is
nearly equal to the united height of the two
lower stages, and is faced entirely with a
delicate diaper of marble cut into small
oblong pieces, which look save in their texture
and color, only too much like bricks.
In this marble-faced wall are pierced a number
of windows with pointed arches&mdash;the
tracery of which has been taken out&mdash;and
in or near the centre of each façade is a
much larger window and a balcony, which
look as though they had been subsequently
inserted. The lowest stage consists of a
long and uniform arcade of very simple
pointed arches resting upon circular columns
with elaborately carved capitals;
these columns have been shortened by
some twenty inches of their old height by
the rise of the water and the consequent
elevation of the pavement, to the great
damage of their effect. The intermediate
stage is a magnificent arcade supporting
very vigorous tracery and divided from the
stages above and below it by large and pronounced
lines of carved and moulded
string-courses.</p>

<p>"It is important to observe that up to
the top of the second string-course the
whole of the architecture is of the very best
kind of Venetian pointed, and is, I believe,
the very best and truest specimen of Gothic
architecture south of the Alps.</p>

<p>"Above this noble work comes the third
stage; and I confess, to my eye, with
patent marks in every stone of which it is
composed that it was designed by some
other hand than that which had been so
successful below. There is something
quite chilling in the great waste of plain,
unbroken wall, coming above the extreme
richness of the arcades which support it;
and moreover this placing of the richer
work below and the plainer above is so contrary,
not only to all ordinary canons of
architecture, but just as much to the ordinary
practice of the Venetians, that I feel
sure that the impression which I have had
from my first acquaintance with drawings
of it is substantially correct; viz., that the
line at which alterations and additions have
been made is to be looked for rather in a
<i>horizontal</i> than in a <i>vertical</i> direction;
that in all probability, consequently, the
builders of 1309 commenced with some
portion of the sea-façade, and gradually
carried on the greater part of the building
to the height of the two stages, as we now
see them, leaving the building finished in
precisely the same way as the corresponding
halls at Padua and Vicenza&mdash;two stories
in height, with arcades covering the
outer walls of the upper as well as of the
lower stage; and that when the council
chamber was found to be too small and
larger rooms were required, another architect
suggested the advantage of obtaining
them by raising an immense story above the
others and without destroying much of his
predecessor's work providing rooms on the
most magnificent scale for the Doge and
his council.</p>

<p>"No one can examine the building without
seeing that there is, not only in the
detail but equally in the general design, a
marked difference between the two lower
stages and the upper stage. In place of
the extreme boldness which marks every
part of the former, we see mouldings reduced
in the latter to the smallest and
meanest section possible; the windows of
the upper stage are badly designed, whilst
the traceries of the second stage are as fine
as they can possibly be; the parapet too is
not equal in its design to any of the lower
work, and crowns with an insignificant grotesqueness
the noble symmetry of the two
lower arcades; and finally the chequer-work
of marble, which forms the whole of
the upper wall, is a mode of construction
which I have not seen in any early work,
though it is seen in the Porta della Carta,
and in other late work.</p>

<p>"Such, then, is the Ducal Palace,&mdash;a
building certainly in some respects of almost
unequalled beauty, but at the same
time of unequal merit; its first and second
stages quite perfect in their bold and nervous
character, and, in the almost interminable
succession of the same beautiful
features in shaft and arch and tracery,
forming one of the grandest proofs in the
world of the exceeding value of perfect
regularity, and of a repetition of good
features in architecture, when it is possible
to obtain it on a very large scale."</p>

<p>The whole Palace forms three sides of
an unsymmetrical hollow square, the
back, or north side, abutting upon St.
Mark's Church. The great internal Court
(<a href="#LXVII">Plate <span class="smcap">LXVII.</span></a>) was begun at the end of the
fifteenth century, but then only partially
completed. It is surrounded on the south,
east and west sides by Gothic arcades of
very similar style to those on the exterior.
Even in the sixteenth century portion the
same main outline was followed, though
the detail is different.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Courtyard, at the
northwest angle adjoining St. Mark's, is
through the Porta della Carta (so called
because official notices were affixed to it),
which was the last Gothic work added to
the Palace. Across the court and opposite
this entrance is a very beautiful staircase
in the early-Renaissance style, built in the
middle of the fifteenth century by Antonio
Ricci. It is called the "Giant's Staircase"
(<a href="#LXVIII">Plate <span class="smcap">LXVIII.</span></a>) from its two colossal and
rather clumsy statues of Neptune and Mars.
Between these statues the doges stood to
be inaugurated.</p>

<p>Reached by this staircase is a second, the
so-called "Golden Staircase" (<a href="#LXIX">Plate <span class="smcap">LXIX.</span></a>),
which derives its name either from the
fact that it was formerly accessible only
to those whose names were entered in the
"Golden Book"&mdash;a list of the Venetian
nobility,&mdash;or from the richness of its
decoration, and this leads to the great
apartments in the interior. It was designed
by Jacapo Sansovino, and completed in 1577.</p>

<p>Owing to a great fire which gutted a
great part of the Palace in 1574, the internal
appearance of the council chambers and
the state apartments of the doges was
completely changed, and a splendid series
of early Paduan and Venetian paintings
which adorned the walls of the chief rooms
was destroyed. The interiors were then
redecorated with their present magnificence,
some idea of which may be gained
from a mere enumeration of those who
shared in the work. As architects there
were Palladio, Sansovino, Scammozzi, Lombardi
and Antonio da Ponte; as sculptors
and decorators Vittoria, Aspetti, Segala,
Campagna, Bombarda and di Silo; as painters
Titian, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, Vivarini,
Palma, Tiepolo, and many others; so
that each room became, as Ruskin has said,
"a colossal casket of priceless treasure."</p>

<p>It will, however, be unnecessary to describe
in detail each apartment illustrated
by our engravings, even did space permit.
Intended as spacious audience chambers to
afford dignified and magnificent surroundings
for the stately scenes which were to
be enacted within them, they are all enriched
in the same general style, with panelling,
carving, and gilded mouldings of
the later Renaissance; the architectonic
decorations being chiefly designed as a
setting for the multitude of noble pictures.</p>

<p>The largest and most important of these
apartments is the Hall of the Great Council
(<a href="#LXX">Plate <span class="smcap">LXX.</span></a>), in which the entire body of
the Venetian nobility met to consider questions
of state. This immense room is fifty-five
yards long, twenty-eight yards wide,
and forty-seven feet high. The greatest of
the Venetian masters were employed upon
the ceiling; the entire east wall is occupied
by Tintoretto's "Paradise"&mdash;said to be
the largest oil painting in the world&mdash;and
the walls are adorned with portraits of the
doges and scenes from the history of the
republic.</p>

<p>In the Sala dello Scrutino or Voting Hall
(<a href="#LXXI">Plate <span class="smcap">LXXI.</span></a>), the forty-one nobles were
elected by whom the doges were afterwards
chosen. Opposite the entrance is a
representation of the triumphal arch
erected by the senate in 1694 to commemorate
the conquest of Morea.</p>

<p>The Sala del Senato (<a href="#LXXII">Plate <span class="smcap">LXXII.</span></a>), was the
hall in which the full senate assembled in
formal session. It is also called the Sala
dei Pregadi because originally notice was
sent to each senator to <i>pregare</i> or summon
him to attend the meetings. Beyond
this room, to the right of the throne, is an
ante-chamber to the private chapel of the
doges. A portion of the ceiling of this
ante-chamber, executed in the seventeenth
century, is shown on page 139.</p>

<p>The Anticollegio (<a href="#LXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap">LXXIII.</span></a>), or waiting
room for the ambassadors, was designed
by Scammozzi, and contains Paul Veronese's
celebrated painting, "The Rape of
Europa."</p>

<p>The Anticollegio leads to the Sala del
Collegio (<a href="#LXXIV">Plate <span class="smcap">LXXIV.</span></a>), in which audiences
were granted to foreign emissaries. On the
raised platform stood the Doge's throne,
and in the stall-like seats around it sat the
state councillors.</p>

<p class="p2">Beginning with the January issue
for 1901, the first issue of its Seventh
Volume, two changes will be made
in <span class="smcap">The Brochure Series</span>.</p>

<p>I. The magazine will be enlarged. Half
as many full-page engravings and half as
many illustrated text-pages as are included
in the present issues will be added to each
number.</p>

<p>II. The price will be increased to $1.00
a year and to ten cents a copy.</p>

<p>In general conduct, purpose, and in the
character of material presented the magazine
will be unchanged.</p>

<p>The Publishers are led to take this step
because they believe that the magazine has
a value and a field which are all its own,
and that its value in that field will be
increased by its enlargement. The value
of the magazine in its present form is
proved by the fact that its subscription list
has shown a constant increase from the
first number to the present time, and was
never so large as it is now; and it is hoped
and confidently believed that every present
subscriber to <span class="smcap">The Brochure</span> will approve
of the change, for the enlarged form will
afford an opportunity to present more material,
to present it more attractively, and
to cover a wider field of interest.</p>
